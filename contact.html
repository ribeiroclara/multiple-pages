    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm Clara Ribeiro, a Political Science graduate who discovered a passion for technology during an exchange
    experience in Australia. Inspired by a tech event in Sydney, I began studying software development and completed Web
    Development and Full Stack courses with SheCodes.
    
    I’ve developed skills in JavaScript, React, Python, and more. With adaptability, strong communication, and a commitment
    to learning, I’m excited to contribute to innovative projects and help drive impactful results.
